I had the privilege to work at Enablon, the most popular software solutions
provider for sustainable business performance. Enablon's software solutions are
trusted by over 1,000 major corporations and tens of thousands of SMEs to
measure and manage their environmental and social performance, ensure regulatory
compliance, mitigate risks, and reduce costs.

I spearheaded the "modernization" of a web framework that closely resembled a
CRM system, transitioning from a legacy page generation approach (server-side
generated) to the adoption of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.

This presentation showcases the foundations of the new framework with
comprehensive documentation, enabling development teams to initiate the
transition effectively.
