I worked as a Full Stack Developer at Wishibam, a dynamic startup operating in
the fashion industry. Wishibam offers a B2C marketplace for consumers and
delivers a B2B solution, a plug & play recommendation tool (chatbot + smart CRM)
designed to enhance the online shopping experience by providing personalized
customer assistance, bridging the gap between the swiftness of online shopping
and the warmth of in-store interactions.

One of my missions is to develop the new back-office for B2B clients. To ensure
all the right conditions for seamless collaboration—without compromising the
quality of deliverables—I had to raise awareness within the UI team about the
challenges that implementing a Design System will solve within the company.
