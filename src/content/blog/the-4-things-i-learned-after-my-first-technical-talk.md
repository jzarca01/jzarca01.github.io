Last week, I gave my second talk on JavaScript development, where I spoke about [Truffle](http://truffleframework.com/) and [Solidity](https://soliditylang.com/) to a group of developers at JS-Republic.
I was very happy with the outcome and hope to continue doing more in the future.
Here are the lessons I can share.

## Preparation is key

I rehearsed three times before the actual presentation. Each time, I went through my speech in front of my computer or other people, taking the time to go over each slide and see what could be improved.
This gave me the confidence needed for the big day.
I knew in advance what the next key points were and didn’t rely solely on my notes to progress.

**Bonus tip**: Since you know the slides well, you can also improvise more easily.

## You don't need to be an expert

I was presenting to a group of developers who had little or no experience with this topic, each having their own areas of expertise.
So, without being an expert myself, I had the opportunity to dive deep into the subject and share everything I had discovered and learned.

**Bonus tip**: To avoid tricky questions, make sure you’ve done extensive research on the topic and have asked yourself some challenging questions beforehand.

##Avoid the demo effect

It’s always the same story. Everything works perfectly at home, but during your presentation, an error message pops up. The stress builds up, silence fills the room, and you start doubting your place as a speaker.

No worries, this happens to everyone—even the best speakers.

I strongly recommend testing your demo at least 10 times in an environment as close as possible to the one you'll have on the day (same machine, same screen size, same Wi-Fi, same actions, etc.).

And in the worst case, record videos. This way, you control the outcome and can always fall back on the recording in case of errors.

**Bonus tip**: If you need to show your code, use a local backup. The same goes for your project dependencies—download them in advance and don’t rely on Wi-Fi during your presentation.

## Don't neglect the discussion

You learn a lot about a topic when researching it.

And discussing it with the audience after your presentation allows you to learn even more and/or see the problem from a different perspective.

It’s all this preparation and these exchanges that will make you an expert.

I’m happy to have given these talks and very grateful to those who listened and didn’t try to put me on the spot.

Because, after all, our goal is to learn more, in a friendly environment.
