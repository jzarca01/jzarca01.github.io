For a month now, I have joined Wishibam, a startup specializing in the fashion industry, as a Lead Frontend Developer.

Wishibam operates a marketplace for B2C customers and offers a B2B solution—a plug-and-play recommendation tool (chatbot + smart CRM) that supports online customers by providing a better shopping experience. This tool bridges the gap between the speed of online shopping and the human touch of physical retail, creating a true phygital experience.

One of my missions is to develop the new back-office for B2B clients. To ensure all the right conditions for seamless collaboration—without compromising the quality of deliverables—I had to raise awareness within the UI team about the challenges that implementing a Design System will solve within the company.
